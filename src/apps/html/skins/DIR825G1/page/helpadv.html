		<h2><a name="InboundFilter">Inbound Filter</a></h2>
		<p>When you use the Virtual Server, Port Forwarding, or Remote Administration features to open specific ports to traffic from the Internet, you could be increasing the exposure of your LAN to cyberattacks from the Internet. In these cases, you can use Inbound Filters to limit that exposure by specifying the IP addresses of internet hosts that you trust to access your LAN through the ports that you have opened. You might, for example, only allow access to a game server on your home LAN from the computers of friends whom you have invited to play the games on that server.</p>
		<p>Inbound Filters can be used for limiting access to a server on your network to a system or group of systems. Filter rules can be used with Virtual Server, Gaming, or Remote Administration features. Each filter can be used for several functions; for example a &quot;Game Clan&quot; filter might allow all of the members of a particular gaming group to play several different games for which gaming entries have been created. At the same time an &quot;Admin&quot; filter might only allows systems from your office network to access the WAN admin pages and an FTP server you use at home. If you add an IP address to a filter, the change is effected in all of the places where the filter is used.</p>

					<dt><strong>Enable SPI</strong></dt>
					<dd>SPI ("stateful packet inspection" also known as "dynamic packet filtering") helps to prevent cyber attacks by tracking more state per session.

			<!--dt><strong>NAT Endpoint Filtering </strong></dt>
			<dd>The NAT Endpoint Filtering options control how the router's NAT manages incoming connection requests to ports that are already being used. </dd>
			
			<dd>
				<dl>
					<dt><strong>Endpoint Independent</strong></dt>
					<dd>Once a LAN-side application has created a connection through a specific port, the NAT will forward any incoming connection requests with the same port to the LAN-side application regardless of their origin. This is the least restrictive option, giving the best connectivity and allowing some applications (P2P applications in particular) to behave almost as if they are directly connected to the Internet.</dd>
					<dt><strong>Address Restricted</strong></dt>
					<dd>The NAT forwards incoming connection requests to a LAN-side host only when they come from the same IP address with which a connection was established. This allows the remote application to send data back through a port different from the one used when the outgoing session was created.</dd>
					<dt><strong>Port And Address Restricted</strong></dt>
					<dd>The NAT does not forward any incoming connection requests with the same port address as an already establish connection.</dd>
				</dl>
			</dd>
			<dd>
				Note that some of these options can interact with other port restrictions. Endpoint Independent Filtering takes priority 
						over inbound filters or schedules, so it is possible for an incoming session request related to an outgoing session to enter 
						through a port in spite of an active inbound filter on that port. However, packets will be rejected as expected when sent to 
						blocked ports (whether blocked by schedule or by inbound filter) for which there are no active sessions. 
						Port and Address Restricted Filtering ensures that inbound filters and schedules work precisely, but prevents some level of 
						connectivity, and therefore might require the use of port triggers, virtual servers, or port forwarding to open the ports needed 
						by the application. Address Restricted Filtering gives a compromise position, which avoids problems when communicating with 
						certain other types of NAT router (symmetric NATs in particular) but leaves inbound filters and scheduled access working as 
						expected.

				Formerly, the terms 'Full Cone', 'Restricted Cone', 'Port Restricted Cone' and 'Symmetric' were used to refer to different 
				variations of NATs. These terms are purposely not used here, because they do not fully describe the behavior of this router's NAT. 
				While not a perfect mapping, the following loose correspondences between the 'cone' classification and the 'endpoint filtering' modes 
				can be drawn: if this router is configured for endpoint independent filtering, it implements full cone behavior; address restricted 
				filtering implements restricted cone behavior; and port and address restricted filtering implements port restricted cone behavior.

			<dt><strong>Anti-Spoof checking</strong></dt>
			<dd>This mechanism protects against activity from spoofed or forged IP addresses, mainly by blocking packets appearing on 
				interfaces and in directions which are logically not possible.</dd>	
		
			<dt><strong>DMZ</strong></dt>
			<dd>If you have a computer that cannot run Internet applications properly from behind the router, then you can allow the computer to have unrestricted Internet access. Enter the IP address of that computer as a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) host with unrestricted Internet access. Adding a client to the DMZ may expose that computer to a variety of security risks; so only use this option as a last resort.</dd>

			<dt><strong>Application Level Gateway (ALG) Configuration</strong></dt>
			<dd>Here you can enable or disable ALGs. Some protocols and applications require special handling of the IP payload to make 
				them work with network address translation (NAT). Each ALG provides special handling for a specific protocol or application. A number of 
				ALGs for common applications are enabled by default.</dd>

					<dt><strong>PPTP</strong></dt>
					<dd>Allows multiple machines on the LAN to connect to their corporate networks using PPTP protocol. When the PPTP ALG 
						is enabled, LAN computers can establish PPTP VPN connections either with the same or with different VPN servers. When the PPTP ALG 
						is disabled, the router allows VPN operation in a restricted way -- LAN computers are typically able to establish VPN tunnels to 
						different VPN Internet servers but not to the same server. The advantage of disabling the PPTP ALG is to increase VPN performance. 
						Enabling the PPTP ALG also allows incoming VPN connections to a LAN side VPN server (refer to Advanced -&gt; Virtual Server ).</dd>

			<dt><strong>Wireless Security Mode </strong></dt>
			<dd>Securing your wireless network is important as it is used to protect the integrity of the information being transmitted. The router is capable of 4 types of wireless security; WEP, WPA only, WPA2 only, and WPA/WPA2 (auto-detect).
				<dl>
					<dt>WEP</dt>
					<dd>Wired Equivalent Protocol (WEP) is a wireless security protocol for Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN). WEP provides security by encrypting the data that is sent over the WLAN. The router supports 2 levels of WEP Encryption: 64-bit and 128-bit. WEP is disabled by default. The WEP setting can be changed to fit an existing wireless network or to customize your wireless network.
						<dl>
							<dt>Authentication</dt>
							<dd>Authentication is a process by which the router verifies the identity of a network device that is attempting to join the wireless network. There are two types authentication for this device when using WEP.</dd>
							<dl>
								<dt>Both</dt>
								<dd>Select Open System or Shared Key for authentication automatically.</dd>
								<dt>Shared Key</dt>
								<dd>Select this option to require any wireless device attempting to communicate with the router to provide the encryption key needed to access the network before they are allowed to communicate with the router.</dd>
							</dl>
							<dt>WEP Key</dt>
							<dd>WEP Key 1 allow you to easily change wireless encryption settings to maintain a secure network. Simply select the specific key to be used for encrypting wireless data on the network.</dd>
						</dl>
					</dd>
					<dt>WPA-Personal and WPA-Enterprise</dt>
					<dd>Both of these options select some variant of Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) -- security standards published by the Wi-Fi Alliance. The <strong>WPA Mode</strong> further refines the variant that the router should employ.
					</dd>
					
					<dt>WPA Mode: </dt>
						<dd>WPA is the older standard; select this option if the clients that will be used with the router 
										only support the older standard. WPA2 is the newer implementation of the stronger IEEE 802.11i security standard. 
										With the "WPA2" option, the router tries WPA2 first, but falls back to WPA if the client only supports WPA. 
										With the "WPA2 Only" option, the router associates only with clients that also support WPA2 security.</dd>
						<dt>Group Key Update Interval:</dt>
						<dd>The amount of time before the group key used for broadcast and multicast data is changed.</dd>
						<dl>
							<dt>WPA-Personal</dt>
							<dd>This is what your wireless clients will need in order to communicate with your router, When PSK is selected enter 8-63 alphanumeric characters. Be sure to write this Passphrase down as you will need to enter it on any other wireless devices you are trying to add to your network.</dd>
								<dl>
									<dt>Pre-Shared Key:</dt>
									<dd>The key is entered as a pass-phrase of up to 63 alphanumeric characters in ASCII (American Standard Code for 
											Information Interchange) format at both ends of the wireless connection. It cannot be shorter than eight characters, 
											although for proper security it needs to be of ample length and should not be a commonly known phrase. This phrase is 
											used to generate session keys that are unique for each wireless client.</dd>
								</dl>
						</dl>
						<dl>
							<dt>WPA-Enterprise</dt>
							<dd>This option works with a RADIUS Server to authenticate wireless clients. Wireless clients should have established 
											the necessary credentials before attempting to authenticate to the Server through this Gateway. Furthermore, it 
											may be necessary to configure the RADIUS Server to allow this Gateway to authenticate users.</dd>
								<dl>
