			README for DLNA Digital Media Server (DMS) - August 3, 2008


==========
Overview
==========

DLNA DMS has been built using the Broadcom UPNP framework. 
The DMS can be built as a library or as a standalone application. 
When the DMS is built as a library it will be linked into the Media Browser application. 
When built standalone, it can be run independently of the Media Browser application.


The DMS can be built and run on several platforms and this includes Linux on MIPS, Linux X86 and Windows. 
Broadcom's will deploy the DMS on its MIPS platforms such as 7405, 7420 etc.
			

	
===================
Build Instructions
===================

=> Building DMS as a library 
-----------------------------

1. Logon to the build server.
2. Go to directory Build/Linux, inside the dms folder.
3. Under BASH shell, run the command. 
	For example for 97405 platform the following should be executed

	. /opt/brcm/scripts/plat 97405 b1

This script sets up the toolchain paths properly
 
4. Run the following command
	make clean all

5. The libbdlna-dms library [shared and static] will be placed under AppLib/bin folder.



=> Building DMS as a standalone application
--------------------------------------------
1. logon to build server.
2. Go to directory Build/Linux, inside the dms folder.
3. Under bash shell run the command 
	. /opt/brcm/scripts/plat 97405 b1
4. run the following command to build DMS for Mips.
	./mips_build.sh
5. The dlna server will be build as a mips application

NOTE: If X86 build is needed:
	i> Do not execute step 3 in above sequence.
     ii> In Step-4 run the x86 script. The command should be 
		./x86_build.sh



============================
Install and Run instructions
=============================

1. Installing the DMS application
---------------------------------

	=> The following libraries are needed by the DMS.

		-> libavcodec.so
		-> libavformat.so
		-> libavutil.so

	   For the ease of execution the libraries may be copied to /usr/lib. 
	   These are FFMPEG libraries that the DLNA server is dependent upon.

	=> After the above libraries are available to DMS, the DMS can be executed as a 
	   standalone application or as a library included with other applications.

	
2. Running the DMS application
-------------------------------

	=> If the DMS is built as a application it can simply be run as any other application. 
		If the DMS is built using the library and included in some other application, the 
		instructions for running the application should be followed.	

	=> Once the DMS is executed, it will start scanning the content directory. The content directoy 
		is provided to the DMS server by the user or the application using the DMS server.

		
3. Populating the content directory 
-----------------------------------

	=> The test data can be any corretly encoded clip and can be kept at any location accesable from the 
	   machine running the DMS server.

	=> The path to the content directory (where the media contents are placed) will be given to the DMS server.
	    If the DMS server is running as a standalone application, it will prompt the user to enter the 
	    content directory path. If the DMS server is running as library included in some application, 
	    it is the application's responsibility to provide the content directory path through the available 
	    interface.
	   
4. Testing the DMS server
-------------------------

5.  Shutting down the DMA server
---------------------------------

	=> If the DMS server is running as a application then 
		pressing "x" followed by enter key will shutdown the DMS server.
		
	=> If the DMS server is running as a library included in the application, it is 
		the responsibility of the application to call the shutdown API of the DMS server.	


===========================
Known issues/ Limitations
===========================

1. SCAN DIRECTORY TAKES A LONG TIME
------------------------------------
	
	The DMS takes a time that is proportional to the size of the content in the content directory. For a 35 GB
    data the DMS takes about 10-13 minutes to fully populate the internal database. This is a known issue and 
	will be addresses in future DMS releases.

2. LPCM NOT SUPPORTED
----------------------

	The DMS uses FFMPEG decode libraries. The build that we have checked in the 
	clearcase does not have LPCM audio support. This issue will be resolved in future releases.

3. LIVE STREAMING PROFILES NOT SUPPORTED
----------------------------------------
	Profiles like TV tuner, CD players etc are not supported.
