INSTALL - nbSMTP 0.9X
---------------------

* Steps to install this software:


   1. Dependencies: 
      - C development environment (tested with GNU gcc).
      - OpenSSL if you need SSL connections with SMTP
        servers (development libraries if you installed
	it from binary packages).


   2. Uncompress the tarball (probably you
      have already done so as you are reading
      this). This is done by running the command:

        $ tar xvzf nbsmtp-0.9X.tar.gz
      or
        $ tar xvjf nbsmtp-0.9X.tar.bz2

      A new directory will be created. Running

        $ cd nbsmtp-0.9X/

      will make it the current working directory.


   3. Run "configure" script. Examples:

        $ ./configure

      if you don't need SSL. Or

        $ ./configure --enable-ssl

      if you need SSL.

   
   4. Run "make" to compile the source code:

        $ make
      
   5. A binary named "nbsmtp" will be created, which
      can be used directly. If you want to install it
      system-wide, run as root:

        # make install

   6. Once everything is installed take a look at
      nbsmtp(8) and nbsmtprc(5). Updated online versions
      of the man pages can be found at:
